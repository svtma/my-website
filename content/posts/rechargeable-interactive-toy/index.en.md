## Abstract

An interactive toy, system, and method of controlling the same. The interactive toy includes a toy housing comprising therein a function device performing user-perceptible, controllable functions; a control circuit controlling the function device; a rechargeable power source providing operating power to the function device and the control circuit; and a charging circuit for contactless receipt of electrical energy and for charging the rechargeable power source when the interactive toy is positioned in a charging zone of a contactless charging device. The control circuit receives a primary signal indicative of an interaction stimulus; a secondary signal indicative of a position of the interactive toy with respect to the charging zone; and, responsive to the primary signal, controls the function device to perform a user-perceptible function selected based on the secondary signal. The interactive toy system includes an interactive toy and a contactless charging device defining one or more charging zones.
