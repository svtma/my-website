## Abstract

A modular toy system comprising a plurality of separate electronic toy modules, each electronic toy module comprising a function device operable to perform a user-perceptible function and a control circuit for controlling the function device; wherein at least a first electronic toy module of the plurality of electronic toy modules comprises a first control circuit, a first function device and a sensor system configured for contactless detection of respective coordinate values of at least two coordinates, each coordinate being indicative of a position or an orientation of at least a second electronic toy module of the plurality of electronic toy modules relative to the first electronic toy module; and wherein the first control circuit is configured to control operation of the first function device based on one or more of the detected coordinate values.
